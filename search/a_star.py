            #                   the stored cost in cost_state, we should expand the node to reach the
            #                   state in a cheaper way. Go to Step 5.
            #                   Else continue to a new round (the next neighbor state) (Step 4.2), since we can 
            #                   already reach the state in a cheaper way.
